## This is an attempt to translate cltl2 into Mandarin

I'm no familiar with tex so I choose the html version.

All files but .html files is ignored. You should get a complete version from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/doc/cltl/cltl_ht.tgz
then you can replace origin html files with the modified files here.

Other versions can be reached from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html
