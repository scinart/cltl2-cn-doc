<P>
<A NAME=STRINGTOSYMBOLSECTION>The</A>
value of the special variable <tt>*package*</tt> must always be a package
object (not a name).  Whatever package object is currently the
value of <tt>*package*</tt> is referred to as the <i>current package</i>.
<P>
  特殊变量<tt>*package*</tt>的值必须始终是一个包对象(不是包名)。<tt>*package*</tt>始终指向<i>当前包</i>。
<P>
When the Lisp reader has, by parsing, obtained a string of characters
thought to name a symbol, that name is looked up in the current package.
This lookup may involve looking in other packages whose external symbols
are inherited by the current package.  If the name is found,
the corresponding symbol is returned.  If the name is not found
(that is, there is no symbol of that name accessible in the current package),
a new symbol is created for it and is placed in the current package as an
internal symbol.  Moreover, the current package becomes the owner
(home package) of the symbol, and so the symbol becomes interned
in the current package.
If the name is later read again while this same package is
current, the same symbol will then be found and returned.
<P>
当Lisp reader读到一个字符串解释成符号时，这个符号在当前包中查到。
查到过程可能包含在其他继承的包的外部符号中查找。如果找到了，
就返回相应的符号，否则(即这个符号在这个包中是不可达(accessible)的)，就在当前包中创建一个符号，
当前包作为这个符号的主包。
<P>
Often it is desirable to refer to an external symbol in some package
other than the current one.  This is done through the use of a
<i>qualified name</i>, consisting of a package name, then a colon, then the
name of the symbol.  This causes the symbol's name to be looked up
in the specified package, rather than in the current one.  For example,
<tt>editor:buffer</tt> refers to the external symbol named <tt>buffer</tt>
accessible in the package named <tt>editor</tt>, regardless of whether
there is a symbol named <tt>buffer</tt> in the current package.  If there
is no package named <tt>editor</tt>, or if no symbol named <tt>buffer</tt>
is accessible in <tt>editor</tt>, or if <tt>buffer</tt> is an internal
symbol in <tt>editor</tt>, the Lisp reader will signal
a correctable error to ask the user for instructions.
<P>
  <tt>editor:buffer</tt>指，包<tt>editor</tt>中的可达的符号<tt>buffer</tt>.
  如果不是这样，Lisp reader会产生一个可以改正的错误(correctable error)来询问用户
<P>
On rare occasions, a user may need to refer to an <i>internal</i> symbol of
some package other than the current one.  It is illegal to do this with
the colon qualifier, since accessing an internal symbol of some other
package is usually a mistake.  However, this operation is legal if
a doubled colon
<tt>::</tt> is used as the separator in place of the usual single colon.  If
<tt>editor::buffer</tt> is seen, the effect is exactly the same as
reading <tt>buffer</tt> with <tt>*package*</tt> temporarily rebound to the
package whose name is <tt>editor</tt>.  This special-purpose qualifier
should be used with caution.
<P>
The package named <tt>keyword</tt> contains all keyword symbols used by the
Lisp system itself and by user-written code.  Such symbols must be
easily accessible from any package, and name conflicts are not an issue
because these symbols are used only as labels and never to carry
package-specific values or properties.  Because keyword symbols are used
so frequently, Common Lisp provides a special reader syntax for them.
Any symbol preceded by a colon but no package name (for example
<tt>:foo</tt>) is added to (or looked up in) the <tt>keyword</tt> package as
an <i>external</i> symbol.  The <tt>keyword</tt> package is also treated
specially in that whenever a symbol is added to the <tt>keyword</tt> package
the symbol is always made external; the symbol
is also automatically declared to be a constant
(see <tt>defconstant</tt>) and made to
have itself as its value.  This is why every keyword evaluates to
itself.  As a matter of style, keywords should always be accessed using
the leading-colon convention; the user should never import or inherit
keywords into any other package.  It is an error to try to apply
<tt>use-package</tt> to the <tt>keyword</tt> package.
<P>
  <tt>keyword</tt>包包含了所有的关键字符号。这些符号必须在所有包中可达，所以冲突不会发生。
  因为它是如此常用，Common Lisp提供了一个特殊的reader语法。任何符号前加一个冒号都是<tt>keyword</tt>包的外部符号。
  <tt>keyword</tt>包中的符号自动被声明为常量(见<tt>defconstant</tt>)，并且是自求值的。
  一个好的风格是，关键字应该始终以前加冒号这做方式使用。用户决不应该import或者继承关键字。
  若将函数<tt>use-package</tt>应用于<tt>keyword</tt>包则会产生一个错误。
<P>
Each symbol contains a package cell that is used to record the home
package of the symbol, or <tt>nil</tt> if the symbol is uninterned.  This cell
may be accessed by using the function <tt>symbol-package</tt>.
When an interned
symbol is printed, if it is a symbol in the keyword package,
then it is printed with a preceding colon; otherwise, if it is accessible
(directly or by inheritance) in the current package, it is printed
without any qualification; otherwise, it is printed with the name of the
home package as the qualifier, using <tt>:</tt> as the separator if the
symbol is external and <tt>::</tt> if not.
<P>
A symbol whose package slot contains <tt>nil</tt> (that is, has no home
package)
is printed preceded by <tt>#:</tt>.  It is possible, by the
use of <tt>import</tt> and <tt>unintern</tt>, to create a symbol that has no
recorded home package but that in fact is accessible in some package.
The system does not check for this pathological case, and such symbols
will always be printed preceded by <tt>#:</tt>.
<P>
In summary, the following four uses of symbol qualifier syntax are defined.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>foo:bar</tt>
<DD>
When read, looks up <tt>BAR</tt> among the external symbols of
the package named <tt>FOO</tt>.  Printed when symbol <tt>bar</tt> is external in its
home package <tt>foo</tt> and is not accessible in the current package.
<P>
<DT><tt>foo::bar</tt>
<DD>
When read, interns <tt>BAR</tt> as if <tt>FOO</tt> were the
current package.  Printed when symbol <tt>bar</tt> is internal in its home package
<tt>foo</tt> and is not accessible in the current package.
<P>
<DT><tt>:bar</tt>
<DD>
When read, interns <tt>BAR</tt> as an external symbol in the
<tt>keyword</tt> package and makes it evaluate to itself.  Printed when
the home package of symbol <tt>bar</tt> is <tt>keyword</tt>.
<P>
<DT><tt>#:bar</tt>
<DD>
When read, creates a new uninterned symbol named <tt>BAR</tt>.
Printed when the symbol <tt>bar</tt> is uninterned (has no home package),
even in the pathological case that <tt>bar</tt> is uninterned but
nevertheless somehow accessible in the current package.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
All other uses of colons within names of symbols are not defined by
Common Lisp but are reserved for implementation-dependent use; this
includes names that end in a colon, contain two or more colons, or
consist of just a colon.
